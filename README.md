## 📜 A Note About Our Code

We believe in **transparency**: We're not professional programmers, and most of our code is AI-generated. We're hobbyists using modern tools to solve real problems. When we write code ourselves, we'll explicitly mark it as human-written, but that's rare. Our strength isn't in writing perfect code - it's in identifying problems and using available tools to solve them.

*Aye, we sail the digital seas with AI as our compass!* 🧭

## ⚓ Our Mission

We're resource aggregation specialists with a simple mission: making existing public information truly accessible. We connect scattered resources through a single, intuitive interface, because finding help shouldn't require searching dozens of disconnected systems.

> *"Public data be meant for all hands on deck, not just those who know the secret maps!"*

## 🗺️ What We Stand For

At FTGG, we don't collect - we **connect**. Our platform serves as a bridge between existing public resources and the people who need them. We believe that artificial barriers created by organizational silos actively harm those seeking assistance, and we're here to change that.

### 🎯 Our Core Principles

- **Public resources should be easy to find**: No one should need to navigate multiple systems to find help
- **Nonprofit competition hurts those in need**: Organizational boundaries shouldn't be barriers to access  
- **United access creates better outcomes**: Connected information leads to better service delivery
- **Technology should remove barriers, not create them**: Simple, unified interfaces make help accessible

## 🚢 Current Initiatives

### 🎧 **Pantry Pirate Radio**

Our flagship project aggregates and streamlines access to food security resources across the web. By creating a unified interface for existing public information, we're making it easier for people to find food assistance when they need it most.

#### ⚙️ How It Works

- 📡 Aggregates publicly available food resource information in real-time
- 🔍 Creates a single, searchable interface with HSDS v3.1.1 compliance
- 🌊 Performs live searches across multiple sources
- ⚡ Maintains brief, temporary caches of recent searches for speed
- 🔒 Requires no personal data collection
- 🎯 Provides direct access to existing resources

#### 🛠️ Current Technical Stack

- **OpenReferral HSDS v3.1.1**: Full compliance with human services data specification
- **AI-Powered Processing**: LLM-based data alignment with confidence scoring
- **Geographic Intelligence**: Continental US coverage with PostGIS spatial optimization
- **Distributed Architecture**: Scalable microservices with Redis-based job processing
- **High Quality Standards**: 90% test coverage, strict type checking, comprehensive validation
- **Multiple Data Sources**: 12+ active scrapers including NYC EFAP, FoodHelpline.org, and more

## 💻 Technical Implementation

FTGG operates on a strict set of ethical principles:

- ❌ No personal data collection
- ✅ Only aggregates publicly available information
- 🔓 Open source wherever possible
- 🎯 Emphasis on accessibility and ease of use
- 🤖 Extreme reliance on AI-generated code with human oversight
- 🔧 Focused on solving problems rather than writing perfect code

---

## 🚀 What's Next

We're actively expanding Pantry Pirate Radio with exciting new features:

- **🌐 API Development**: Building comprehensive public APIs following OpenReferral HSDS v3.1.1 specification
- **🖥️ Front-End Interface**: Creating intuitive web interfaces for direct public access to aggregated data
- **🗺️ Feeding America Network**: Developing scrapers for all Feeding America network food banks nationwide
- **📍 Enhanced Coverage**: Expanding our geographic coverage and data source integration

These developments will make food security resources even more accessible to those who need them most.

## 🤝 Working With Data Sources

We actively seek collaboration with organizations whose data we aggregate. While we believe in unrestricted access to public resource information, we're committed to being good digital citizens.

### 📢 To Organizations Whose Data We Use

- 👋 We want to work with you directly
- 💬 We're happy to discuss proper integration methods
- 🎯 We aim to minimize impact on your infrastructure
- ⏱️ We'll respect rate limits and access patterns you suggest
- 🏷️ We maintain transparent operations and attribution

### 🔗 Integration Possibilities

We're open to formal partnerships, with some core requirements:

- 🌐 Data must remain publicly accessible
- ⚖️ Integrations must align with our core principles
- 🔓 Any shared code will remain open source
- 📝 We're happy to sign NDAs for partnership discussions
- 📊 All aggregated data remains public by default

Our ideal scenario is working together to better serve people in need. Let's talk about how we can collaborate while maintaining our mutual principles.

## 👥 Contributing

We welcome contributions from developers, designers, and anyone passionate about making public resources more accessible. Don't worry about code perfection - we certainly don't. Focus on solving problems and making resources more accessible.

### 🏴‍☠️ Development Approach

- 🤖 All code is AI-generated using modern LLM tools (Claude, GPT-4)
- ⚡ Focus on rapid iteration and problem-solving over perfect code
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage and validation systems
- 🤝 Collaborative development with emphasis on results, not ego
- 🌊 Open to all skill levels - if you can describe the problem, we can solve it together

## 📜 Important Disclaimers


### 🏴‍☠️ Terms of Service Compliance Notice

This software intentionally bypasses certain Terms of Service restrictions that we believe harm public good. Specifically:

- We aggregate data through automated means (scraping, API access, proxied searches)
- We cache and republish public information for accessibility
- We create unified interfaces for siloed systems

While we maintain attribution and respect the original sources of information, we prioritize public good over Terms of Service that create artificial barriers to public resource information.

### 📊 Data Usage

- ✅ We only aggregate publicly available information
- ❌ We do not collect personal data
- 🏷️ We maintain attribution to original sources
- 🔒 We respect and maintain any privacy-related restrictions
- 💰 We do not monetize or sell any aggregated data
- ⚡ We only cache search results temporarily for performance
- 🔍 All searches are performed live unless recently cached

### ⚠️ Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
